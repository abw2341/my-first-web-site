    The Russian Empire</a>, also known as <u>Imperial Russia</u> or simply <strong> Russia</strong>,
    was a vast realm that spanned most of northern Eurasia from its proclamation in November 
    1721 until its dissolution in March 1917. At its height in the late 19th century, 
    it covered about 22,800,000 square kilometres (8,800,000 sq mi), roughly one-sixth of the world's landmass,
     making it the third-largest empire in history, surpassed only by the British and Mongol empires; it also held colonies 
     in North America between 1799 and 1867. The empire's 1897 census, the only one it conducted, found a population of 125.6 million 
     with considerable ethnic, linguistic, religious, and socioeconomic diversity.
